Building: 
	As cycles:          (1 5 4 6 7)
	As a biection:      (2 3)
	With fixed size:    id

Myltiplication
	 (1 2 3) · (1 3 2)   = id
	 (1 2) · (4 5 6)     = (1 2)(4 5 6)
	 (1 5) · (5 6)       = (1 5 6)

Powing
	(1 2 3) -> (1 2 3)
	(1 2 3) -> (1 3 2)
	(1 2 3 7 8 12 22 11 10) -> (1 11 12 7 2 10 22 8 3)
